            My name is Joseph Buiteweg (pronounced <em>byu-te-weg</em>), but I go by Joey. I’m a Software Engineer and Musician from Ann Arbor, Michigan; living in Austin, Texas; and I am passionate about <strong>systems software</strong> and <strong>security</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>I developed these passions while completing a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering and Master’s in Computer Science from the University of Michigan.

    My main technological interests lie in any of the intersections of Computer Security, Embedded Systems, Web Systems, Distributed Systems, and Networking.
<p>
<p>
    In my spare time I enjoy producing music, playing the Saxophone and Piano, and staying healthy through strength training and playing Ultimate Frisbee. I also enjoy watching sports, especially Michigan Football, and playing video games.
