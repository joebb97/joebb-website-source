# My Personal Blessings

First, I'd like to acknowledge that as a cis-gendered, straight, white man and the son of two Lawyers, I am incredibly blessed and privileged to have lived the life I have.

I am fortunate to have grown up in Ann Arbor, MI and attended public schools that are well funded and have a decently diverse student body.

I attribute any success I have to that fact that I had a stable upbringing, two wonderful and successful parents who I look up to as role-models, 
and a strong network of people supporting me along my journey in life.
