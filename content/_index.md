# Welcome!

My name is Joseph Buiteweg (pronounced _byu-te-weg_), but I go by Joey. I'm a Software Engineer and Musician from Ann Arbor, Michigan, and I am passionate about **systems software** and **security**. 

My main interests lie in any of the intersections of Computer Security, Embedded Systems, Web Systems, Distributed Systems, and Networking.
