# Welcome!

My name is Joseph Buiteweg (pronounced _byu-te-weg_), but I go by Joey. I'm a Software Engineer and Musician from Ann Arbor, Michigan; living in Austin, Texas; and I am passionate about **systems software** and **security**.

I developed these passions while completing a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and Master's in Computer Science from the University of Michigan.
