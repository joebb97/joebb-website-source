# Welcome! 
---

My name is Joseph Buiteweg (pronounced _byu-te-weg_), but I go by Joey. I'm a Software Engineer and Musician from Ann Arbor, Michigan, and I am passionate about **systems software** and **security**. 

My main interests lie in any of the intersections of Computer Security, Embedded Systems, Web Systems, Distributed Systems, and Networking.

In my spare time I enjoy producing music, playing the Saxophone and Piano, and staying healthy through strength training and playing Ultimate Frisbee.
I also enjoy watching sports and playing video games, especially Super Smash Bros.

If you're interested in learning even more about me, my values, and my goals, head [here]({{< ref "/about/index.md" >}})

Otherwise feel free to look around!
