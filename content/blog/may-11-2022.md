title: "Languages. Mainly those used for programming."

This is all w.r.t my agreement with [this article](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg/), 

and my frustration with Programming Languages that have been taken out of their design domain. 

## Some poetry about assembly
```
miss me with some donald knuth
    saying that I should do assembly.

miss me with some assembly language.
miss me with some.

    I = {x86, CISC},
    "CISC" == Complex Instruction Set Computer

That. I = {x86, CISC}. Am. is not for humans.
{amd64, x86}               is not for humans.

  Yes. amd64 == x86_64. Fun fact.
  In general, amd64 == x86. History!

ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) is almost, but not quite, for humans,

  "RISC" == Reduced Instruction Set Computer.
  Yes. That's what ARM stands for. Fun Fact.

## My HAWT Takez

I am a human. And I don't read assembly because. Well. 
I am not a *literally* spineless, brainless piece of silicon.
I function outside the constraints of a digitally oscillating nanofabricated clock.
Not an analog clock. One made of electricity. That clock. Does not think.
It { adds, divides, subtracts, multiplies } at the speed of GHz.
Billions of times per second (*literally*).

  Do not. Try to equate my brain with that poopy-doodoo robot brain called
{ siri, alexa, google voice assistant }. That is, total nonsense! Donald Knuth.
Here's what should probably happen.

```
START:
  DO:
    while(bad code || sad || unproductive) {
        write POSIX shell;
        if (posix shell too complicated) {
          write in pseudocode;
          if (sufficient) {
            continue
          } // end if
          // otherwise
          write in a real ding-danging PL; // A good one!
          /* A real academic, robust, "enterprise ready" programming language.
           * There are so many whose names are *not*. **NOT**. ABSOLUTELY NOT { 
                python{
                  2, 2.7. 3.3, 3.7. 3.9, /etc.
                }
                (not)JavaScript (this one should really be JavaShit),
                TypeScript,
                Ruby
             }
           * I say these languages aren't "enterprise ready" because they were not designed.
           * Adequately.
           * For the problems we try to apply them to, such as {
                banking,
                ecommerce,
                social media,
                military,
                embedded devices (like Belkin's worthless 'digital light switches!
                                  it should just be a  light switch. not a computer.
                                  change my mind. you probably won't),
                Smart TVs (seriously most of these things are giant pieces of garbage,
                           because well. I'm gonna guess there's some really unperformant
                           interpreted [i.e slower, that is a fact, not an opinion], {dynamic, duck, weakly}-typed
           * }
           */
      };
  };
END:
```
