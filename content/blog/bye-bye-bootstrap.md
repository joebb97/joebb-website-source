I haven't posted recently but have been working on my website.

A major effort was removing Bootstrap CSS and utilizing hugo's `assets` folder more heavily.

The CSS for this site is now entirely based on CSS `grid`. 

I turned on some minifying and image features too.

I also migrated from GitHub pages to Cloudflare Pages.

I also made some grammatical updates to the articles.

All of this is visible in the site's [source code](https://github.com/joebb97/joebb-website-source) and git history.

Feel free to check it out and take inspiration from what you see!
