I want this site to be friendly, honest, useful, and to convey [my interests and values]({{< ref "/about" >}}).

## Friendly

People learn best when they feel welcomed and accepted. It's hard to feel this way in the face of coarse technical discussion. Articles here will present ideas as friendly as possible, while remaining honest.

## Honest

Everything on this site is my own, honest opinion, not my employer's.

Much of programming and tech is subjective with few absolutes. If you disagree with the content you see here, don't hesitate to reach out. Honest and friendly discussions are welcomed.

## Useful

I've gotten immense help from other peoples' programming blogs --- help I'd like to repay. Teaching and helping others is fulfilling, and writing is an excellent outlet for that.

I was not born knowing what I know; other people have helped me get to where I am. I'm hoping that documenting my struggles with new things I learn will comfort those who've faced similar difficulties.

Many have been saved by reading someone's encounter with the same esoteric and pain-staking problem they're tackling. StackOverflow, various StackExchange sites, people's blogs, spec-sheets, and user documentation are all crucial to the landscape of learning software. My dream is for someone to randomly stumble across one of my posts via search engine, get use from it, and then go about their day one step closer to solving their problem.
