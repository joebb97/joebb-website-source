## Why is your website pink?

My website is pink because I enjoy pink and pastel colors. I appreciate their friendly and comforting qualities, both of which I try my best to bring to my interactions with others.

## Thoughts on workplace discrimination of all shapes and sizes?

Let's avoid that in any way possible.

Technology should try to be everything-neutral and provide net good to real people.

## How about those same forms of discrimination in higher-education?

Let's also avoid that in any way possible.

## Why do you have a website / blog?

I've gotten tons of help and useful info from other peoples' programming blogs and articles, and I want to give back in a similar way. I also love teaching and helping others, so I view this site as the perfect outlet for that.

I was not born knowing what I know - other people have helped me get to where I am. It's important us engineers acknowledge our struggles, as it helps comfort those who face the same difficulty in learning the skills needed in our respective fields. I'm hoping that documenting my struggles with new things I learn will help on this front.

Most people in tech have been saved by reading somebody else's encounter with the esoteric and pain-staking problem they're tackling. StackOverflow, various StackExchange sites, people's blogs, spec-sheets, and user documentation are all crucial to the landscape of learning software. My dream is for someone to randomly stumble across one of my posts via search engine, get some use out of it, and then go about their day one step closer to solving their problem.

## These are all just your opinions, right?

Yes everything on this site is my own personal opinion and doesn't necessarily reflect that of whoever employs me at any given time. Some might even call what I write here **jokes** and **satire**, but sadly words will only get us so far.

Much of programming and tech is quite subjective with only some absolutes. The above disclaimer is quite important.

If you disagree with the content you see here, don't hesitate to reach out. I love discussing most all topics related to tech, even the most subjective ones.

## Will you tell us even more about yourself?

Sure! Head on over to [this pagey dagey]({{< ref "/about" >}})
