# Joey's Personal Website/Blog

This here is the code for my personal website. My goals were:

- To learn a static site generator
  - I've made a few client and server side dynamic websites using Flask, Jinja, and React, so I figured it'd be good to learn a static generator at some point.
- No [yavascript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript), please no [yavascript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)
- No paying for things
- I own the content
- Not [this](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) but [this](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/)
  - (i.e not an un-styled blob of HTML that looks like a demo made by Tim Berners-Lee in the 90s)
- Fast load, build, and deploy
- Support for markdown
- Responsive CSS (looks good on Mobile) without me needing to write nonsense @media-queries
- Not just using a theme somebody else wrote. Because I need to be a special snowflake.

Which is why I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Hugo's docs and learning resources could use some work, but it has an active community and some good tutorials out there. Bootstrap is amazing, I've used it before. It saves me loads of time.

I probably could've saved myself a few weekends and evenings of time using Wordpress, SquareSpace, Wix, or Drupal, but that's like, TOO MAINSTREAM MAN.

I followed the [Anubis](https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis) and [Hugo-Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) as a guideline in making my own

This project is in no-way intended to be usable by anyone but me (it is not meant to be a plug-and-play theme), but feel free to reference its implementation if you like.
